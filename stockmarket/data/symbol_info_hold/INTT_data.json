    "longBusinessSummary": "inTEST Corporation designs, manufactures, and markets thermal management products and semiconductor automated test equipment interface solutions worldwide. The company operates in two segments, Thermal Products (Thermal) and Electromechanical Semiconductor Products (EMS). The Thermal segment offers ThermoStream temperature management tools, MobileTemp systems, ThermoChambers, Thermal Platforms, Thermonics temperature conditioning products, and EKOHEAT and EASYHEAT induction heating systems. Its products are used to test semiconductor wafers and ICs, electronic components and assemblies, mechanical assemblies, and electromechanical assemblies. The EMS segment provides in2 and Cobal Series manipulators that hold various test heads and enable an operator to reposition a test head for alternate use with various probers or handlers on a test floor; and docking hardware products that protect the interface contacts and ensure repeatable and precise alignment between the test head's interface board and the prober's probing assembly or the handler's test socket. This segment also offers tester interfaces that provide electrical connections between the tester and the wafer prober or IC handler to carry the electrical signals between the tester and the probe card on the prober or the test socket on the handler. Its products are used in production testing of wafers and specialized packaged ICs in back-end testing by semiconductor manufacturers. The company markets and sells its products directly, as well as through ATE manufacturers, independent sales representatives, and distributors to semiconductor manufacturers, semiconductor test subcontractors, third-party foundries, test and assembly houses, and original equipment manufacturers. inTEST Corporation was founded in 1981 and is headquartered in Mansfield, Massachusetts.",
